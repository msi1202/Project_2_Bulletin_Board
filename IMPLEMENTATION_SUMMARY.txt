IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
================================================================================

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
- Language: Python 3
- Networking: Pure sockets (socket module)
- Threading: Python threading module
- Protocol: JSON over TCP
- No third-party libraries

KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:

Part 1 - Public Message Board (40 points):
✓ Server listens on configurable non-system port (default: 8888)
✓ Client registration with unique usernames
✓ Join public group functionality
✓ Display last 2 messages when joining
✓ List all users in the group
✓ Real-time notifications for joins/leaves
✓ Post messages visible to all group members
✓ Message format: "ID, Sender, Date, Subject"
✓ Retrieve full message content by ID
✓ Leave group functionality
✓ Graceful handling of disconnections

Part 2 - Multiple Private Groups (30 points):
✓ 5 private groups (tech, sports, music, books, movies)
✓ List all available groups
✓ Join multiple groups simultaneously
✓ Post messages to specific groups
✓ Group isolation (users can't see other groups)
✓ Group-specific user lists
✓ Leave specific groups independently
✓ All Part 1 features extended to groups

Usability (15 points):
✓ All required commands implemented
✓ Help command with full documentation
✓ Clear error messages
✓ Intuitive command syntax with % prefix
✓ Real-time notification system
✓ Responsive user interface

Documentation (15 points):
✓ Comprehensive code documentation
✓ Docstrings for all classes and methods
✓ Inline comments for complex logic
✓ Expressive variable names
✓ Complete README with examples
✓ Makefile for convenience
✓ Multiple guides and checklists

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Server Architecture:
- Main thread accepts incoming connections
- Separate thread for each client connection
- Thread-safe operations using locks
- Asynchronous notification broadcasting
- Proper client cleanup on disconnection

Client Architecture:
- Main thread handles user input
- Separate listener thread for notifications
- Non-blocking notification display
- Graceful error handling

Protocol Design:
- JSON-based request/response format
- Commands: REGISTER, JOIN, POST, USERS, LEAVE, MESSAGE, GROUPS, etc.
- Status codes: SUCCESS/ERROR
- Structured response with relevant data

Data Structures:
- Groups: Dictionary mapping group_id to Group objects
- Messages: List of Message objects per group
- Clients: Dictionary mapping username to socket
- Client-Groups: Dictionary mapping username to set of group_ids

Threading and Concurrency:
- Thread-per-client model for scalability
- Locks protect shared data structures
- Notification threads prevent blocking
- Proper thread cleanup and daemon threads

================================================================================
COMMANDS IMPLEMENTED
================================================================================

Connection:
  %connect <host> <port>        Connect to server
  %exit                         Disconnect and exit

Part 1 - Public Board:
  %join                         Join public group
  %post <subject> <content>     Post message
  %users                        List users
  %leave                        Leave group
  %message <id>                 Get message by ID

Part 2 - Private Groups:
  %groups                       List all groups
  %groupjoin <id>              Join group
  %grouppost <id> <subj> <msg>  Post to group
  %groupusers <id>             List group users
  %groupleave <id>             Leave group
  %groupmessage <id> <msg_id>   Get group message

Other:
  help                          Show help

================================================================================
TESTING
================================================================================

Tested Scenarios:
1. Single client connection and basic operations
2. Multiple concurrent clients (3-5 clients)
3. Public message board functionality
4. Multiple private group functionality
5. Group isolation and privacy
6. Real-time notifications
7. Error handling (invalid commands, duplicate users, etc.)
8. Graceful disconnection handling
9. Concurrent message posting
10. Thread safety and race conditions

All functionality verified working correctly.
